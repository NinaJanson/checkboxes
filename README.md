Task to practice JS.

Implement a web app that will implement a tricky toggle behavior of three checkboxes.

Requirements:
Add three checkboxes with labels (fast, cheap and good)
Implement the feature that not all checkboxes can be checked at the same time
If the third checkbox is checked you have to uncheck the one that got checked before
